## This is WIP.


We use shadcdn/ui [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components.

## Getting Started

## Install the NPM dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
